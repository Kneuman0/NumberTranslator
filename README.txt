Number Translator
README

This program will translate any number less than 10 million into literary accurate words. The format has been design for use on checks where the cents are included at actual digits rather than their respective words.

Example: 
input 457393.03
output: Four hundred fifty-seven thousand three hundred ninety-three and 3 cents

input 47
output: Fourty-seven and 0 cents

To run the GUI, navigate to the numTranslator package and then to the NumberTranslatorMain class and run it.
